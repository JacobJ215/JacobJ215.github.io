### Machine Learning Guide
[Machine Learning Guide](https://jacobj215.github.io/Machine-Learning-Guide/)


***Please not that is guide is still a work in progress**

The idea behind this Intro to Machine Learning Guide was to initially create a list of resources to provide to my students. This eventually morphed into a comprehensive guide that will eventually cover everything from Linear Regression to Neural Networks
