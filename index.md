### Machine Learning Guide
[Machine Learning Guide](https://jacobj215.github.io/Machine-Learning-Guide/)


***Please note that is guide is still a work in progress**

The idea behind this Intro to Machine Learning Guide was to initially create a list of resources to provide to my students. This eventually morphed into a comprehensive guide that will eventually cover everything from Linear Regression to Neural Networks


### Computer Vision Projects

This is a data analysis and machine learning project that focuses on analyzing the stats of Pokemon from the popular Pokemon game series. The project utilizes Python and various data analysis libraries to explore and visualize the data, as well as perform statistical analysis on the Pokemon stats and machine learning to make predict a pokemon's legendary status.
